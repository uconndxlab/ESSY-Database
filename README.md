# ESSY Project & Database

### How to Use:

1. To get started, upload an `.xlsx` file with the contents of a report for 1 or more student.

   1. Note that the title of the tab with the content must be: _Qualtrics Output_

2. After uploading an `.xlsx` file a batch of PDF files will be generated.

   1. Each batch will have the PDF files for the student information that was included in the file.
   2. You can download the entire batch as a compressed ZIP file, or a single report PDF file.

3. You have the option to delete individual reports, as well as entire batches of reports.
